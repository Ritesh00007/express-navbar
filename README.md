# Three-Route Express Application with Flexbox Navigation

## CSC 317 Homework Assignment

This project is a Node.js/Express application that hosts three separate routes, each corresponding to a unique assignment:

1. Climate Crisis
2. Typesetting
3. Four Algorithms

The application features a navbar built with flexbox that allows users to navigate between these routes. Each route redirects to the GitHub repository for the corresponding assignment.
